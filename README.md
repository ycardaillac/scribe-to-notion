# Scribe to Notion

Import Amazon Scribe notes to Notion database.

## Development

```bash
poetry install
poetry run pytest
``` 

## Why this project?

I'd like to be able to import notes and highlights from my Amazon Scribe to Notion, but I couldn't find any easy way to do it.
This project is an attempt to solve this problem while learning Clean Architecture and getting better at making AI code for me.

## Current limitations:

- Works only with Scribe notes in French
- Works only with Highlights
- Was 99% coded by Claude/Cursor and guided closely by me, but who knows...
